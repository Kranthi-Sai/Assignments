2. explain the feature of nodejs like non-blocking, synchronous, single threaded.
ans:-
Singlethreaded:
>>node.js uses a single call stack so it is called single threaded.
non-blocking:
>>A non-blocking operation in Node js does not wait for I/O to complete
synchronous:
>>when a event operations occurs like onclick,timeout etc
>>those functions push to node.js further it push to event loop
>>when it treged then it push to call stack to process in this way we achieved synchronous in node.js
