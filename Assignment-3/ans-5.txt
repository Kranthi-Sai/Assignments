5.why should we use let in place of var in our javascript programs?
ans:
>>var and let are used to define variables. 
The only difference is in the scope they provide for variables defined using them.
Scope of a variable, in simple terms is the section of code where the variable is visible.
Outside its scope, the variable does not exist.
